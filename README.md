# Mobile Phone Market Entry Analysis ðŸ“±ðŸ“Š
**Predictive Modeling & Clustering Approach to Support Business Expansion Decisions**

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project evaluates whether a mobile phone company should enter the Indian market by leveraging insights from the Chinese market. It involves exploratory data analysis, logistic regression for consumer prediction, and clustering to identify customer segments.

By training a classification model on Chinese data and applying it to Indian consumer data, the analysis provides a data-driven recommendation for market entry.
